# Dethroning GPS: Pinpoint 5G Positioning Systems Using Machine Learning

This repository explores the potential of machine learning (ML)-based positioning techniques to surpass GPS as the dominant technology for location-based services (LBS) in 5G networks. 

## Abstract

The limitations of GPS, particularly in urban environments and indoor spaces, are addressed. Alternative positioning methods leveraging ML algorithms are emerging as a viable alternative. This research investigates fingerprinting triangulation and beaconing, demonstrating their potential to provide highly accurate and reliable location information.

## Project Goals

- Evaluate the effectiveness of ML-based positioning techniques in 5G networks.
- Compare the accuracy of fingerprinting triangulation and beaconing methods against traditional GPS.
- Analyze the impact of environmental factors (signal interference, obstacles) on these methods.
- Explore the potential for integrating these techniques for robust indoor and outdoor positioning.

## Key Findings

- ML-based positioning techniques (fingerprinting triangulation, beaconing) demonstrate promising results, offering higher accuracy than GPS, particularly in challenging environments.
- These methods can be robust to signal strength variations but may be affected by signal interference and obstacles.
- Careful consideration is needed to balance accuracy and resource requirements (data collection time).

## Applications

- Enhanced navigation and location-based services in urban areas and indoor spaces (e.g., shopping malls, airports, public buildings)
- Improved emergency response and asset tracking
- Personalized advertising and targeted marketing based on real-time location data
- Development of innovative applications leveraging precise indoor positioning
